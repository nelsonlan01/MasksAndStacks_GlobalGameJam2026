============================================
【Playloop / Instruction】

The player randomly chooses the topic (a noun), for example, "spade", but DO NOT reveal the topic at this time.

The player can only draw 1 stroke on each plastic sheet, with each player having 3 sheets.

The stroke can draw in ANY direction, but can only utilise ONE straight line, in any direction, but no scribbles allowed.

Then the player casts one of sheet from their hand in any orientation, and the next player should cast the sheet on-top-of the previous player.

In an n-player game, each casted deck will only contain n cards.

Players should discuss what they accidentally create, or its appeals, or something, and guess the original "word".

After that, the topic will be revealed. The closest guess to the original meaning will get 1 mark.

【Winning Condition】
The game will continue for more n+1 rounds, and the highest score will win the game.
